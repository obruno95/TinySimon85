I compiled the program using Uno as ISP and Spence Konde's ATTiny Core (https://github.com/SpenceKonde/ATTinyCore)

* Select the ATtinyx5 series option under the ATtiny Universal heading on the Boards menu
  * Timer 1 Clock: CPU
  * B.O.D. Disabled
  * ATtiny85
  * 1 MHz (internal) 
  
 This is the default fuse setting on new ATtiny85s; 
 otherwise choose Burn Bootloader to set the fuses appropriately.
